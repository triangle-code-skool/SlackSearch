# SlackSearch
Mini-project consisting of ingesting Slack user identities to trigger off an OSINT crawler, piping the packaged JSON to a Supabase endpoint. We cache and query records to then interface the database to create a sleek UI providing likelihoods of same users existing elsewhere on the web.
